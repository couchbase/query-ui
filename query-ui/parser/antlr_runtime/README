Our javascript N1QL parser relies on the Antlr4 runtime. The version
installable via npm is not currently compatable with our runtime
environment, because includes references to node.js libraries
(specifically 'fs'). The downloadable runtime is in source code form,
so it needs packaging to work.

These steps rely on webpack v5.

Here are the steps:

1) Download the latest javascript runtime, e.g.:

curl https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-javascript-runtime-4.9.2.zip

2) unzip it

3) use webpack to package it using the webpack.config.js file here.

4) add an "export" statement so we can import it.
