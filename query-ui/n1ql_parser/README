Problem: the N1QL parser is written in goyacc, and is thus tied to golang.

What if we want to parse N1QL in another language? My initial attempt
at creating a JavaScript N1QL parser using jison worked, but was too
much work to maintain. How to automatically extract the ever-changing
N1QL grammar rules from the goyacc definiton? With a parser, of
course.

I created an antlr lexer for N1QL manually (automating that was too
much work, but it should be easier to keep up to date). It is found in
the file n1ql_lexer.g4.input.

Then I created an antlr parser for goyacc, which extracts all the
grammar rules and outputs them as antlr rules, along with the N1QL
lexer.
