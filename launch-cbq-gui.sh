# This script is used to launch a stand-alone program which supports a web-based query
# workbench for Couchbase on its HTTP listen port. While there exists a query workbench
# integrated into the Couchbase Admin UI (from 4.5 onward), the purpose of this script
# is to support querying for people without admin credentials. 
#
# Before running this script, you must "cd" to the directory where the script is
# located.
#
# The following variables should work for a basic install of Couchbase on the local
# machine:
#  GUI_PORT is the port that you can go to with a web browser to see the GUI, 
#           e.g., :8095
#  COUCHBASE_URL is the URL you would go to to see the Couchbase web console, 
#           e.g., http://localhost:8091
#  USER and PASS and the administrator login/password for the Couchbase cluster. 
#  You may or may not need these depending on the Couchbase version. E.g.
#           Couchbase Server 4.1.2
